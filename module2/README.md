# Overview

This project is a simple, interactive To-Do List application built entirely with TypeScript, HTML, and CSS. It allows users to create, edit, complete, remove, filter, and reorder tasks, while persisting data locally in the browser using localStorage.

The goal of this project is to strengthen understanding of TypeScript fundamentals and DOM manipulation by building a small but complete front-end app from scratch â€” no frameworks required.
