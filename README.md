# Overview

In this project, I created a simple software application using the R programming language to demonstrate my understanding of its syntax and capabilities. The software performs basic data analysis tasks, including data manipulation, statistical calculations, and visualization.

This software allows users to input a dataset, perform exploratory data analysis, and generate visualizations such as histograms and scatter plots. It also includes functions for calculating summary statistics like mean, median, and standard deviation.

The purpose of writing this software was to enhance my proficiency in R programming, particularly in data analysis and visualization. I aimed to create a user-friendly tool that could assist in understanding datasets and extracting meaningful insights.
